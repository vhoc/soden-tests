                            <p>Her leadership perspective and management approach are rooted in empathy and understanding. These principles are informed by extensive experience working on both sides of the built environment design process — as an owner and a design services leader. Kelley’s intention to design healthy spaces for future generations led her to EcoRise, first as a volunteer, and now as Vice-Chair of the Board of Directors, which has continued to inspire her to help create positive global change through mentorship and education. She is a LEED and WELL accredited professional, and a Fitwel Ambassador. Her focus is on driving future design solutions with sustainability and well-being in mind. She creates opportunities to be outside as much as possible, from cycling on her new gravel bike to hiking in Colorado, Catskills and the Berkshires.</p>

                            <p>A passionate steward of sustainability, he incorporates sustainable solutions into all aspects of his work. With a bachelor’s degree from the University of California, Berkeley in Sustainable Design, and a Master of Architecture from the Boston Architectural College, Arran combines his design sense and technical skills to tackle sustainability issues from an informed, wholistic perspective. Sustainability is a ubiquitous field that requires cross-disciplinary knowledge to ensure its success. Not only has Arran experience as an architectural designer, but he has also worked in the digital manufacturing, city planning, and construction fields. Arran’s multi-faceted experience contributes to fruitful collaborative work with architects, engineers, and contractors, which he does on a daily basis. Outside of work, Arran’s extensive use of digital CAD software has developed into a desire to construct his ideas in three-dimensions. His architectural work has developed into hands-on hobbies such as furniture-making, tailoring, and electronics repair. Arran combines his skills in 3D scanning, GIS, and digital manufacturing to bring his designs to life with his 3D printers and CNC cutter.</p>
